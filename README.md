# My Tailwind Responsive Footer Challenge

---

### About This Project

I built a responsive website footer using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**. It’s meant to look clean and modern, and it adjusts nicely to different screen sizes. The layout and design were inspired by a screenshot I wanted to replicate closely.

### How It's Set Up

The footer has three main parts:

#### 1. Newsletter Section  
There’s a short message inviting users to subscribe. It includes a basic form with an email input and a subscribe button. On small screens, everything stacks; on bigger screens, the layout shifts to side-by-side.

#### 2. Quick Links  
A short list of useful links like:
- Home  
- Who We Are  
- Our Philosophy  

They’re spaced out and styled to be simple but clear.

#### 3. Technologies  
Another list showing some basic web tech:
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

### Tools I Used

- HTML5  
- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

### To Test It

Just open the HTML file in a browser and resize the window to see how it behaves across different screen sizes.

Nothing too fancy, just keeping it consistent with the rest of the design.
